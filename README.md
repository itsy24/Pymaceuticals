Over the course of 45 days, 248 mice were tested to determine the efficacy of nine cancer medications for the treatment of squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) with a placebo used as a control group and a starting tumor volume of 45mm3.


The results of the study varied across the board. For example, Ketapril had the highest average tumor volumes and Infubinol had an outlier. Of the nine drugs, Ramicane proved to be the most effective in reducing tumor volume with an average tumor volumes of 40.22 mm3. However, Capomulin still proved to be quite effective with an average tumor volume of 40.68 mm3, which is 1% higher from Ramicaneâ€™s average but 30% lower from Ketapril's average. 


With that, further investigation should be done to determine if other factors affected the study results. For example, a positive correlation was found between mouse weight and average tumor volume, which means that as a mouse's weight increases so does the tumor volume. Also, determining if gender affects the effect of the drug would be beneficial, due to pharmocogenetics proving that a person's genetic makeup affects the efficacy of any medication.
